Created using Django, Bootstrap CSS and Vanilla JS. It is my first foray into web development.

As such it is created by "exploratory design". Everything is done on MVP basis. Clarity and extensibility took a backseat. Sometimes working with the tools, sometimes against them.
There will be a refactor in the future, whenever this stops being enough.
#
Things within, that are beyond standard django website:
* session variables manipulation with AJAX requests
* custom navbar
* markdown embedding with syntax highlighting
