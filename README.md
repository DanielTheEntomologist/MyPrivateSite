This repository contains source code of my private site.
Created using Django, Bootstrap CSS and Vanilla JS,
#
It is actually my first website.
As such it is created by "exploratory design". Everything is done just to work without consideration for clarity and extensibility. Sometimes working with the tools sometimes against them.
There will be a refactor in the future, whenever this stops being enough.
#
Things within, that are beyond standard bog standard django website:
* session variables manipulation with AJAX requests
* markdown embedding with syntax highlighting
